0 INVOLVES a 1 DISCUSSION of either two or three different pictures, depending on which exam you do. This part of the exam is called 'Long Turn' because you need to speak by yourself for 1 minute without 2 PAUSING. When you have finished, you then need to listen to the other candidate as you will be asked a question about their photograph.

Most students 3 DESCRIBE the photographs in this part of the test. This is 4 UNWISE _. You will not be 5 REWARDED for this. It is better to compare the 6 SIMILARITIES and differences between two of the photos. It is also a good idea to use linking words and 7 SPECULATIVE language. Moving 8 FREQUENTLY from one photo to the other, is also a good tactic. If you want to see more examples and learn more detailed tips and techniques, have a look around my website.
